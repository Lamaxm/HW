            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <li>Melt butter and olive oil in an 8-quart saucepan over medium heat.  Add onions, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent.  Do not fry the onions.</li>
            <li>Add meat broth, sherry and thyme.  Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven grill.</li>
            <li>Place soup in oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer).  Layer each slice of bread with provolone, half a Swiss slice, and 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese.  The utensils are placed on a cookie sheet and roasted in the preheated oven until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.</li>
